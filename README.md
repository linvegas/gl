# Learning OpenGL

Exercises on graphics programming based on the [learnopengl](https://learnopengl.com) website and book.

To generate glad.c and all the include files, you need to go [here](https://glad.dav1d.de), as clarified and recommended on the book.

## Setup

You will need [glfw](https://www.glfw.org) installed in your system and `make` to build the program.

Just run this:

```console
$ make
```
